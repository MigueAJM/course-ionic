### Notes:
- component -> [ion-back-button:](https:ionicframework.com/docs/api/back-button) The back button navigates back in the app's history when clicked.
- class -> [ion-text-capitalize](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities): Forces the first letter of each word to be converted to uppercase.
